Well, where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.
Oh, a little farther - only a little farther, Ellen, climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.
But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to follow.

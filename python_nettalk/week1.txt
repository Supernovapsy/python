+++PYTHON TIPS&TRICKS+++
duration: 50 minutes

Goals:
1. Provoke the audience's interest in programming.
2. Show people why Python is the best programming language in the world.
    How?
    1. Comparison against C/C++/Java.
    2. Show using examples.
    3. Show using practical examples (i.e. interview questions and other simple
    problems)
    4. Demonstrating some useful and powerful technical elements of the
    language.

8:10 - 8:20: Refresher of Python
8:20 - 8:30: Small but useful & powerful Tips & Tricks
8:30 - 8:40: The myriad of libraries in Python
8:40 - 9:00: Put it to practice - Python interview example questions

Program style aim: interactive
Refresher:
- Simple but interesting challenges which can be implemented using the language basics.
- Go over a concept, and raise a challenge.
- Have 2 conglomerating challenges towards the end.

Tips&Tricks:
- Go over each concept, and let people try it out. These "tricks" are
  one-liners and so people can type them out themselves.

Python Libraries:
- Go over the libraries one-by-one, only for very interesting and quick ones do
  you give challenges for people to complete.

Motivation:
Comparison between C and python. @ ctci/1/2.py && ctci/1/2.c

Refresher:
basics:
    iterators
    lambda
    map, reduce, itertools.imap @ PE/006.py
    Sequence unpacking @ fib.py

Tips:
    generators, any(), using booleans as index @ PE/008.py
    Dict tips (uniquification, counting, keeping references, inverting keys and
    values using zip and itertools.izip) @ ctci/1/1.py, PE/008.py
    listcomps, dictcomps, setcomps, frozenset @ tipsntricks.py/common_dicts
    https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity @ Everywhere applicable
    collections.deque @ careercup/7.py
    heapq @ trip planning
Tips without examples:
    any object can take on a new attribute.
    [] * -1

Interview questions:
ctci/9/2.py = frozenset, dict, listcomp, both dict features.
careercup/1.py - find shortest matching substring. DP.
trip planning (still to be coded). Dijkstra, heapq

Libraries:
sys
os
shutil
glob
zlib
zipfile

timeit
cProfile

doctest
unittest
logging

re

math
random
datetime

array
string, string.Template

urllib2
smtplib

threading

If have enough time:

decimal
array
bisect
itertools.product
itertools.combinations, itertools.combinations_with_replacement,
    itertools.permutations
itertools.chain
collections.namedtuple
collections.Counter
collections.OrderedDict
collections.defaultdict

Fun fact:
zip is an involution.
    Let a and b be two tuples.
    Let c be of a list containing a and b.
    zip(*zip(*c)) = c

Hello everyone and weclcome back from the New Year. First off, we'd like to
apologize for having a late first talk, we know you have anticipated HA's
events. So, to help you transition back into Hacker Academy, we have prepared a
series of talks in various domains of technology ready for the month of January.

The first of these talks will be on "Python Tips & Tricks", or, if you would
like, "Python is the best programming language in the world". It will be
presented by one of Hacker Academy's execs, Wen, who will be sharing with you
the following:

1. A quick refresher of Python.
2. Some useful tips and tricks he has encountered using the language.
3. Some powerful and interesting libraries from the vast library vault of Python.
4. Lastly, a few programming interview questions which uses these tips and
tricks, along with well-known algorithm and data structures techniques.

Lastly but not least, the talk will be interspersed with small programming
exercises designed to get your programming muscles all fired up. As a talk
which is designed to be hands-on, bring your laptop (installed with Python and
your favourite text editor) to get the most out of the talk.

Haven't programmed in Python before? Only have basic experience programming?
Don't worry. Take a little time to read some parts over the official Python
tutorial (it's short!) and it will get you a long way into this talk's material.

Remember, Google and documentation can be your best friends.

Hope to see you there!

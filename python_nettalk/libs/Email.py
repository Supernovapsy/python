# Usage: use send_email(), but add the domain-to-host mapping in the dict before doing so.

# INPUT: user and recipients are email addresses, the rest are self-explanatory.
# OUTPUT: specific return codes have different meanings:
# 0: success
# 1: smtp sending failed.
# 2: domain-to-host mapping not defined.
